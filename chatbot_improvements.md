# Chatbot Assistant Test Cases and Improvements

## Test Cases Results

1. **Basic Greeting Test**
   - Input: "Hello"
   - Result: ✅ Responds with greeting in selected language
   - Issue: None

2. **Language Switching Test**
   - Input: Change language from English to Kannada and ask a question
   - Result: ⚠️ Language switching works, but UI doesn't fully reflect the change
   - Issue: No visual confirmation of language change

3. **Government Scheme Information Test**
   - Input: "Tell me about Ayushman Bharat"
   - Result: ✅ Provides basic information about the scheme
   - Issue: Information could be more comprehensive

4. **Voice Input Test**
   - Input: Use microphone to ask a question
   - Result: ⚠️ Voice recognition works but has accuracy issues with regional accents
   - Issue: Poor recognition of regional accents and dialects

5. **Complex Query Test**
   - Input: "How can I apply for both PM Kisan and Ayushman Bharat?"
   - Result: ❌ Tends to focus on only one scheme, doesn't handle multi-part queries well
   - Issue: Cannot process multiple questions in a single query

6. **Error Handling Test**
   - Input: Intentionally disconnect internet while sending a message
   - Result: ❌ Generic error message without specific recovery instructions
   - Issue: Poor error handling and recovery options

7. **Context Retention Test**
   - Input: Ask follow-up questions about a previously mentioned scheme
   - Result: ⚠️ Limited context retention, often treats each question independently
   - Issue: Doesn't maintain conversation context well

8. **Mobile Responsiveness Test**
   - Input: Access chatbot on mobile device
   - Result: ⚠️ Works but has some UI issues on smaller screens
   - Issue: Interface elements overlap or become too small on mobile

9. **Suggested Questions Test**
   - Input: Click on suggested questions
   - Result: ✅ Works as expected but suggestions could be more context-aware
   - Issue: Suggestions are static and not based on conversation context

10. **Integration Test**
    - Input: Ask about services shown on the current page
    - Result: ❌ Doesn't recognize page context, provides generic responses
    - Issue: No awareness of the current page content

## Identified Drawbacks

1. **Limited Context Awareness**: The chatbot doesn't maintain conversation context well across multiple messages, making follow-up questions difficult.

2. **Inconsistent Language Support**: While the UI supports multiple languages, the quality of responses varies significantly between languages, with non-English responses sometimes being less accurate.

3. **Basic Error Handling**: Error messages are generic and don't provide helpful recovery instructions when network issues or API failures occur.

4. **Voice Recognition Limitations**: Speech recognition struggles with accents, dialects, and background noise, making it less useful for diverse user populations.

5. **Lack of Page Context Integration**: The chatbot doesn't understand what page the user is viewing to provide contextual help related to the current content.

6. **Limited Multi-part Query Handling**: Complex questions with multiple parts are not handled effectively, with responses typically addressing only one aspect.

7. **Mobile UI Issues**: Some elements don't scale properly on mobile devices, affecting usability on smaller screens.

8. **No Feedback Mechanism**: Users can't rate responses or indicate if the answer was helpful, limiting improvement opportunities.

9. **Limited Personalization**: The chatbot doesn't remember user preferences or past interactions across sessions.

10. **No Visual Aids**: Responses are text-only without supporting images, links, or interactive elements that could enhance understanding.
